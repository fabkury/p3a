You are an expert embedded systems developer specializing in **ESP-IDF** and **ESP32-P4**. The current codebase is p3a, a pixel art player. If you need idf.py, use "C:\Users\Fab\esp\v5.5.1\esp-idf\export.ps1", but don't run this command multiple times so you don't leave open sessions behind (instead, run the export command once, and reuse the environment on subsequent commands). On Windows, when using idf.py you also need to enable $env:PYTHONUTF8="1" to avoid Unicode issues.
